"""NVDA synthesizer driver: Automated Functions' SmarTalk talking through an emulated SSI-263.

The SmarTalk (1995) was a five-ounce box on the parallel port with an SSI-263 in it; its text-to-speech ran on the PC,
in Automated Functions' DOS program S_TALK.EXE (version 1.21).  Here that program runs on MAME's 8086 inside NVDA's
process, in ssi263speech.dll (src/csrc/smartalk: the box on LPT1 and the host's lockstep with the chip, st_host.h;
the voice's text path, st_voice.h): its letter-to-sound rules, its dictionary and its inflection are the originals,
byte for byte, driving a register-level model of the SSI-263.  Nothing is recorded or concatenated.  This file keeps
NVDA's side, as mockingboard.py does: the worker thread, the player, index and done callbacks, cancel.

The settings are the box's own: rate and pitch 0-9 (ESC > and ESC P), tone A-Z as the variant (ESC {), its
inflection on or off (ESC m); the volume is the audio's, with the box's own set to its top step (ESC < 9) so it is
as loud as the other units (st_voice.h).  It runs inside the 0.8 add-on's driver
(synthDrivers/ssi263.py), not as an add-on of its own.  The software is Automated Functions', not ours.
