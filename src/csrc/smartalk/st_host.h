/* st_host.h -- Automated Functions' SmarTalk in C: src/hosts/smartalk.py, line for line, on MAME's 8086 (../pc86).
 * The box's own DOS text-to-speech, S_TALK.EXE version 1.21 (1995-11-15: the rules and dictionary in conventional
 * memory), loaded as DOS would with the installer's command line (L1 I7 T0 F3 S1) until it stays resident, in a bare
 * PC that stands in for DOS and the BIOS: the box on LPT1 (378h-37Ah) with the chip's A/R on ACK and IRQ7 (vector
 * 0Fh), a BIOS timer (the power-up waits for 40 ticks), and text in as a screen reader sent it, INT 17h to LPT1.  The
 * box's lines are smartalk.py's (as read from the TSR and confirmed by it speaking): the data latched into the
 * register control bits 1-3 select when /STROBE is released, ACK = A/R, ERROR = INIT, SELECT high, BUSY and PAPER-OUT
 * at a powered box's levels.
 *
 * Where it differs from smartalk.py: nowhere on purpose.  boot() is smartalk.py's: ST_RUN.EXE's two lines (the "{"
 * that lets the rules speak), played out silently.
 *
 * Only version 1.21 is known to work (the TSR's data segment at CS:0538, its queue at 01E2 and its speaking flag at
 * 01EC): sth_create refuses an image without its banner.  The program comes from the caller and is never built in.
 * cpu_ips 5,000,000 is the Python host's coupling of instructions to chip time, not a clock.  Not thread-safe per
 * instance.  MIT.
